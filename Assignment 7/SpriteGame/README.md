This project expands on the base SpriteGameOpenTK demo (https://github.com/mouraleonardo/SpriteGameOpenTk) by adding 2 new movement mechanics and a animation state machine. I added a jump and sprint mechanic by holding the shift key while moving.

The state machines works for Idle, Walk, Sprint, and Jump. The player can only jump while grounded, and jump transitions back to idle when landing.
